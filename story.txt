"""Calunk, calunk, goes your luggage case against the gaps between the pavement squares running alongside the tracks. Its sound echoes before you through the mostly-empty tunnels of the subway. Above, dim off-white fluorescent lights partially flood the halls, making the support pillars and rest benches cast stark shadows across your path.

It's a chilly evening and you're on your weekly trip home from a long week of work. Courvetry County, your home, is a long way from Newbaum City, so it's easier to travel twice a week rather than every day.

You look at your printed ticket again - the walk feels longer than usual tonight, but you can't trust the clocks of the station to tell you what time it is; they never work, and if they do work, they're never right. The ticket says, 'Station 6'.

As you walk past another concrete support pillar, a voice drenched in the pillar's shadow calls out to you, "Hey, stranger...".

(1) See what they want.
(2) I just want to go home."""

"Hi?" you say.
"... hi..." they reply. "You getting on a train, stranger?"
"Well, I'm certainly not just passing through here," you reply.
Their eyes narrow. "Oh, you'd be surprised how many do... where you riding to?"
"That's my business, thanks."
"Fair enough, but if you're riding the train to the end of the line... careful that you don't ride past it." The figure closes their eyes and seems to almost disappear into the shadows.
"Sorry?"

No response. Whoever it was, maybe they just left. You look around, but you can't seem to find them in the tunnel. 

The lights overhead blink with a staticky pop. City infrastructure is really crumbling. You look around to find you're only at Station 4, and your train arrives in fifteen minutes - best to quick-step it.

Your home's station is a lot more lively than the city station. The lights are a warm, strong color and plenty of people are still milling about. Even some food stands are still open at this late hour.

You stop to buy a funnel cake and sit down at the bus stop outside the station to eat it. Soon, a bus will arrive to take you home and you can finally rest.

In your dream, the corn stalks are 100 feet tall and 100 feet wide, way too thick to see or push through. You go left, left, right, but can't find a way out.

You begin to climb one of the corn stalks out of desperation, maybe you can see the layout of the maze from a height. But at the top it's so high you can't see the maze anymore, you only see a girl in a white nightdress.

You reach a hand out to her shoulder to get her attention, but she turns to look at you, her hair covering her face, and says,

"... now leaving Peregrine County Station."

You startle awake in your seat, the sleep leaving your head. You rub your face and look around - you're the only one left on the train. Did the intercom just say Peregrine County? Crap, that's a few stops past yours.

Your eyes catch a route map on the wall of the train and you get up to walk over and look at it. Yep, Peregrine County is three stops past yours... huh, it also happens to be the last stop on the route.

You vaguely remember the stranger's advice.

"Next stop, Hel-lllb---krzzt" The intercom crackles. "All passengers, please remain sea-zzkra-please get off the train. This is the final stop. This is the final stop.

You could break a window, but that runs the risk of committing a crime, and squeezing yourself and your luggage out could be dangerous. And it might take too long. Trying to do it at a hi-speed would be suicide.

The emergency exit would definitely open, and it'd be the most easy way out, but you're not sure how happy the train company would be with you opening it just because you missed your stop. The fine would probably be heavy, too... you don't like the sound of having to stretch your budget this month just for that.

Your last option of course, would be to just keep riding the train... but that intercom's audio glitch makes you feel uneasy to stay on the train.
